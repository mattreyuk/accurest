    = Spring Cloud Contract Verifier Messaging

Spring Cloud Contract Verifier allows you to verify your application that uses messaging as means of communication.
All of our integrations are working with Spring but you can also set one yourself.

== Integrations

You can use one of the three integration configurations:

- Apache Camel
- Spring Integration
- Spring Cloud Stream

If you're using Spring Boot, the aforementioned test configurations will be appended automatically.

== Manual Integration

The `spring-cloud-contract-verifier-messaging-core` module contains 3 main interfaces:

- `ContractVerifierMessage` - describes a message received / sent to a channel / queue / topic etc.
- `ContractVerifierMessageBuilder` - describes how to build a message
- `ContractVerifierMessaging` - class that allows you to build, send and receive messages
