=== Stub Runner Spring Cloud

Registers the stubs in the provided Service Discovery. It's enough to add the jar

[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
org.springframework.cloud.contract:stub-runner-spring-cloud
----

and the Stub Runner autoconfiguration should be picked up.

==== Stubbing Service Discovery

The most important feature of `Stub Runner Spring Cloud` is the fact that it's stubbing

- `DiscoveryClient`
- `Ribbon` `ServerList`

that means that regardles of the fact whether you're using Zookeeper, Consul, Eureka or anything else, you don't need that in your tests.
We're starting WireMock instances of your dependencies and we're telling your application whenever you're using `Feign`, load balanced `RestTemplate`
or `DiscoveryClient` directly, to call those stubbed servers instead of calling the real Service Discovery tool.

==== Additional Configuration

You can match the artifactId of the stub with the name of your app by using the `stubrunner.stubs.idsToServiceIds:` map.
You can disable Stub Runner Ribbon support by providing: `stubrunner.cloud.ribbon.enabled` equal to `false`
You can disable Stub Runner support by providing: `stubrunner.cloud.enabled` equal to `false`
