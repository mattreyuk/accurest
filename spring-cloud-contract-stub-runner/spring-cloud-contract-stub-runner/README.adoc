=== Stub Runner Core

Runs stubs for service collaborators. Treating stubs as contracts of services allows to use stub-runner as an implementation of 
http://martinfowler.com/articles/consumerDrivenContracts.html[Consumer Driven Contracts].

Stub Runner allows you to automatically download the stubs of the provided dependencies, start WireMock servers for them and feed them with proper stub definitions.
For messaging, special stub routes are defined.

==== Running stubs

===== Running using main app

You can set the following options to the main class:

[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
 -maxp (--maxPort) N            : Maximum port value to be assigned to the
                                  Wiremock instance. Defaults to 15000
                                  (default: 15000)
 -minp (--minPort) N            : Minimal port value to be assigned to the
                                  Wiremock instance. Defaults to 10000
                                  (default: 10000)
 -s (--stubs) VAL               : Comma separated list of Ivy representation of
                                  jars with stubs. Eg. groupid:artifactid1,group
                                  id2:artifactid2:version:classifier
 -sr (--stubRepositoryRoot) VAL : Location of a Jar containing server where you
                                  keep your stubs (e.g. http://nexus.net/content
                                  /repositories/repository)
 -ss (--stubsSuffix) VAL        : Suffix for the jar containing stubs (e.g.
                                  'stubs' if the stub jar would have a 'stubs'
                                  classifier for stubs: foobar-stubs ).
                                  Defaults to 'stubs' (default: stubs)
 -wo (--workOffline)            : Switch to work offline. Defaults to 'false'
                                  (default: false)

===== Building a Fat Jar

Just call the following command:

[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
./gradlew spring-cloud-contract-stub-runner-root:spring-cloud-contract-stub-runner:shadowJar -PfatJar
----

and inside the `build/lib` there will be a Fat Jar with classifier `fatJar` waiting for you to execute. E.g.

[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
java -jar spring-cloud-contract-stub-runner/spring-cloud-contract-stub-runner/build/libs/spring-cloud-contract-stub-runner-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-fatJar.jar -sr http://a.b.com -s a:b:c,d:e,f:g:h:i
----

==== Stub runner configuration

You can configure the stub runner by either passing the full arguments list with the `-Pargs` like this:

[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
./gradlew spring-cloud-contract-stub-runner-root:spring-cloud-contract-stub-runner:run -Pargs="-c pl -minp 10000 -maxp 10005 -s a:b:c,d:e,f:g:h"
----

or each parameter separately with a `-P` prefix and without the hyphen `-` in the name of the param

[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
./gradlew spring-cloud-contract-stub-runner-root:spring-cloud-contract-stub-runner:run -Pc=pl -Pminp=10000 -Pmaxp=10005 -Ps=a:b:c,d:e,f:g:h
----

===== HTTP Stubs

Stubs are defined in JSON documents, whose syntax is defined in http://wiremock.org/stubbing.html[WireMock documentation]

Example:

[source,javascript,indent=0]
----
{
    "request": {
        "method": "GET",
        "url": "/ping"
    },
    "response": {
        "status": 200,
        "body": "pong",
        "headers": {
            "Content-Type": "text/plain"
        }
    }
}
----

===== Viewing registered mappings

Every stubbed collaborator exposes list of defined mappings under `__/admin/` endpoint.

===== Messaging Stubs

Depending on the provided Stub Runner dependency and the DSL the messaging routes are automatically set up.
