=== Stub Runner JUnit Rule

Stub Runner comes with a JUnit rule thanks to which you can very easily download and run stubs for given group and artifact id:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/test/groovy/org/springframework/cloud/contract/stubrunner/junit/StubRunnerRuleJUnitTest.java[tags=classrule]
----

After that rule gets executed Stub Runner connects to your Maven repository and for the given list of dependencies tries to:

- download them
- cache them locally
- unzip them to a temporary folder
- start a WireMock server for each Maven dependency on a random port from the provided range of ports / provided port
- feed the WireMock server with all JSON files that are valid WireMock definitions

Stub Runner uses https://wiki.eclipse.org/Aether[Eclipse Aether] mechanism to download the Maven dependencies. 
Check their https://wiki.eclipse.org/Aether[docs] for more information.

Since the `StubRunnerRule` implements the `StubFinder` it allows you to find the started stubs:

[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
include::../spring-cloud-contract-stub-runner/src/main/groovy/org/springframework/cloud/contract/stubrunner/StubFinder.groovy[]
----

Example of usage in Spock tests:

[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
include::src/test/groovy/org/springframework/cloud/contract/stubrunner/junit/StubRunnerRuleSpec.groovy[tags=classrule]
----

Example of usage in JUnit tests:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/test/groovy/org/springframework/cloud/contract/stubrunner/junit/StubRunnerRuleJUnitTest.java[tags=test]
----

Check the *Common properties for JUnit and Spring* for more information on how to apply global configuration of Stub Runner.

==== Providing fixed ports

You can also run your stubs on fixed ports. You can do it in two different ways. One is to pass it in the properties, and the other via fluent API of
JUnit rule.

==== Fluent API

When using the `StubRunnerRule` you can add a stub to download and then pass the port for the last downloaded stub.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/test/groovy/org/springframework/cloud/contract/stubrunner/junit/StubRunnerRuleCustomPortJUnitTest.java[tags=classrule_with_port]
----

You can see that for this example the following test is valid:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/test/groovy/org/springframework/cloud/contract/stubrunner/junit/StubRunnerRuleCustomPortJUnitTest.java[tags=test_with_port]
----
